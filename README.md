# Weather Boy v1.0

Weather Boy is a Discord bot written in Node.js. At its core, Weather Boy is meant to be an easy way for Discord users to request simple, up-to-date information about the weather conditions in their area.

Weather Boy uses MapBox's geocoding API for reverse geocoding (latitude and longitude from place name) and DarkSky's API for weather data.

We've got a landing page now! Check out https://vosslerbr.github.io/Weather-Boy/ to see it.


## Current Features
- Current weather information
	- Temperature
	- Wind bearing and speed
	- Humidity
	- Daily summary (for current day)
- 5 day forecast
	- High
	- Low
	- Daily summary (one for each day)

## Future Plans
- Hourly forecast
- Icons to make the reponses a bit more user-friendly
- Alerts (like severe storms, blizzards, etc)
- Migrate to OpenWeatherMap API since DarkSky API will shut down eventually
- Upgrade API plans to paid plans if bot were to reach wide adoption (if call limits become an issue)
